Welcome to my machine-learning assignment about linear regression! 
In this assignment, I acquired an in-depth understanding of linear regression through practical labs.

In assignment 2, I pursue the Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition, Multiclass. The code sets up a simple feedforward neural network architecture using TensorFlow API.
