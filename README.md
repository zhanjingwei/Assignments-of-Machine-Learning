Welcome to my machine-learning assignment about linear regression! 
In this assignment, I acquired an in-depth understanding of linear regression through practical labs.

In assignment 2, I pursue the Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition, Multiclass. The code sets up a simple feedforward neural network architecture using TensorFlow API.

In assignment 3. Decision trees stand as stalwart structures. These hierarchical models, resembling the branching logic of a tree, offer a comprehensible approach to classification and regression tasks. As we delve into the intricacies of decision trees, we uncover not just lines of code, but the essence of decision-making in the digital domain.
